### The Dataset

This project is sourced from the [City of Seattle Official Website](https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/Collisions/g983-vrct), in which the data is collected by the [City of Seattle GIS Program](https://www.seattle.gov/tech/initiatives/open-data). All collisions are provided by SPD and recorded by Traffic Records. It is consistently updated every week. As of April 25, 2022, there are 234,522 rows (observations) and 40 columns (features) in this dataset. The data was collected in order for the city of Seattle to keep track of all collisions that occur within the city. When working with this data, the following ethical concerns should be addressed:

- Do certain factors, such as race or gender, influence the level of severity recorded for a collision?
- What factors influence whether a collision is recorded at all?
- Is a certain gender more likely to cause collisions than others?
- Does race play a role?
