### Analysis

 it allows us to look at all the possible road conditions and easily assess the main cause of collisions. We decided not to combine all the values into one big chart as it would be messy and difficult to interpret.

From the Weather Conditions chart, we see that there are 119,681 collisions that occurred in Clear weather. Clear weather accounted for five times more collisions than Rainy weather, which was the second most collision on the chart (35,411 collisions).

From the Road Conditions chart, we see that dry roads account for the most amount of collisions (134,262 collisions) while Rainy Roads had roughly three times as less collisions (50,833 collisions).

From the Light Conditions chart, most collisions occur when there is daylight outside (124,356 collisions) than the night time with streetlights on (52,592 collisions).

Based on our created chart, we learn that low visibility and bad weather conditions are not the main cause of collisions in Seattle. This was shocking to see as Seattle is a city with one of the highest days of rainfall in the United States and we expected the rainy weather and difficulty to see to be a big cause of collisions. Most collisions occurred during the daytime, when the weather was clear, and when the road condition was dry. From this chart, we can conclude that you are more likely to get in a collision even if the weather and road conditions are “perfect” and “ideal”.
