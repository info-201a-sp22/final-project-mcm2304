### Purpose

We included this table since it breaks down different parts of the dataset concisely and efficiently from 2004 to 2021. It includes four different categories that includes the number of collisions that occurred with the driver under the influence, number of collisions that resulted in injuries, the number of people involved and the overall total collisions.

The number of collisions that occurred with the driver under the influence has remained relatively steady with around 400-800 drivers from 2004-2019. However, there are no cases of under influence of alcohol or drugs in 2020 and 2021, which is impressive and quite unbelievable. There must be errors in collecting data since there are also thousand of NA values in this column. The number of injuries has also remained relatively steady with 4000-6500 injuries from 2004-2019. The number of people involved definitely varies a lot more which makes sense since the number can easily vary from 2- around 20 depending on how many people were in each car during each collision. The total number of collisions per year shows a steady decrease from 2005 to 2010, followed by a steady increase until 2015 followed by a dramatic decrease. Overall the table shows dramatic differences in numbers in 2020 and 2021 which is explained by the COVID-19 pandemic as less people were driving during quarantine which led to less collisions overall.
