### Abstract

Our primary concern is to determine which types of traffic collisions are most likely to occur in the City of Seattle and who is most likely to be involved. This is a critical question because it pertains to the public safety of our community and population. To address the question, we will examine our data to determine the most likely locations, vehicle types, and severity of collisions.

### Keywords

### Introduction  

As teens and young adults, one major milestone and accomplishment is obtaining a driver's license. Throughout the driving course, students learn how to correctly maneuver a vehicle, laws regarding right-of-way, and the safety of everyone on the road. With this in mind, we are curious to see which scenarios account for the most injuries and deaths on the road as driving a car is the most common method of transportation in the United States.

1. Are collisions becoming more common as time progresses and more people are driving or does it remain the same throughout the years?
 
2. Which type of roads account for the most injuries and deaths?

3. What environmental factors (conditions) may have caused the incident?

4. What type of collision is more common?
 
5. Are cyclists, pedestrians, and motorcyclists more likely to be struck, or are collisions between cars and trucks more prevalent?
