### Limitations and Challenges

In this dataset, there are a large number of observations, which means that it may be difficult to clean up and select useful data for further analysis. Because there are more than two hundred thousand rows of data, it will be difficult to find relevant information and focus our research on a few key questions. After a quick skim through the dataset, it becomes clear that there are numerous blank spaces and NA/null values. Despite the fact that it is desirable to have a diverse set of data, there is a possibility that certain columns will only contain a small number of entries, resulting in weaker evidence for us. Another issue with this dataset is that it is updated on a weekly basis, which is a constant source of contention. Because weÂ insist on having the most up-to-date information, we have to download the new CSV file as soon as it is released on a regular basis. Another significant issue that arises is a lack of representation. With old data, the people who were collecting could have easily limited their records to people of color while neglecting to keep track of everyone else. Since the early 2000s, this dataset contains information, and it is useful to have historical information to compare with because there may be many discrepancies and inconsistencies as a result of technological advancement.
